### University of Bristol âˆ™ Research Computing Training

Welcome! My name is Alastair Tanner and I teach computing skills with the University of Bristol Research Software Engineering group. 

On this page you will find my current courses. These are aimed at learners wishing to build their computing confidence and gain a strong coding foundation. We teach with software engineering principles at heart, so that code is clean, reusable, efficient and understandable. Our wider goals are to promote computer literacy within research, leading to better communication of methods, interpretation of results, and skillsharing within groups. We welcome everyone from beginners to experts, scientists to artists!

Jupyter Lab allows us to create and run code, in a browser tab. In this short guide, we cover getting started with Jupyter.

However, the command line can seem daunting to newcomers... if the command line seems intimidating, unfriendly, or frustrating, this course is for you!

{{< admonition type="tip" title="BioPython" open=true >}}
[<img align="left" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alleetanner/code-teaching/main/assets/biopython.png" width="120" style="margin-right: 15px; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;" />](https://alleetanner.github.io/biopython/) The Python library BioPython has been developed to manage, process and analyse sequence information. In this course we introduce working with genetic information as nucleotides, amino acids and codons. We also cover genetic repositories, and how to search them for sequence information.

Streamlit provides a pure Python approach to building data apps and dashboards. It also interfaces with cloud services, bypassing common hurdles associated with publishing web pages.
