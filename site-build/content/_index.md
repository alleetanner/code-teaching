### University of Bristol âˆ™ Research Computing Training

Welcome! My name is Alastair Tanner and I teach computing skills with the University of Bristol Research Software Engineering group. 

On this page you will find my current courses. We teach with software engineering principles at heart, so that code is clean, reusable, efficient and understandable. Our wider goals are to promote computer literacy within research, leading to better communication of methods, interpretation of results, and skillsharing within groups.

To newcomers, however, the command line can be intimidating or frustrating: build your confidence with this course!
