### University of Bristol âˆ™ Research Computing Training

Welcome! My name is Alastair Tanner and I teach computing skills with the University of Bristol Research Software Engineering group. 

On this page you will find my current courses. These are aimed at learners wishing to build their computing confidence and gain a strong coding foundation. We teach with software engineering principles at heart, so that code is clean, reusable, efficient and understandable. Our wider goals are to promote computer literacy within research, leading to better communication of methods, interpretation of results, and skillsharing within groups. We welcome everyone from beginners to experts, scientists to artists!

## [<i class="fa fa-dollar-sign"></i><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> Introduction to the Command Line](https://alleetanner.github.io/intro-to-command-line/)
The command line is a way for us to communicate with computers at a more fundamental level than the familiar graphical interface. However, the command line can seem daunting to newcomers... if the command line seems intimidating, unfriendly, or frustrating, this course is for you! In this session you will
- demystify what the command line is saying
- understand the syntax and logic of commands
- learn how to move around a computer's file system, making moving and deleting files
- gain an introduction to powerful command line tools for automating tasks

We also provide more advanced sections on pipes and redirects, working with remote computers, as well as some basics for bioinformaticians.

## [<i class="fa-solid fa-dna"></i><i class="fa-brands fa-python"></i> BioPython](https://alleetanner.github.io/biopython/)
The Python library BioPython has been developed to manage, process and analyse sequence information. This course aims to provide learners with 
- an overview of the capabilities of BioPython
- an introduction to sequence repositories
- run some analyses to examine the sequence information for particular characteristics.

Where appropriate, this course may also include some material on preparing submission scripts for SLURM-managed computing clusters.

## [<i class="fa-solid fa-cube"></i> <i class="fa-brands fa-python"></i> Data Visualisation with Streamlit](https://alleetanner.github.io/data-vis-with-streamlit/)
- Check back in 2023!
In this workshop we introduce the Python data-app library, Streamlit. This is a framework for producing dashboards and user interfaces, using a streamlined Python API. In this workshop we will
- look at an overview of the design and potentials of Streamlit
- create a simple data-app by writing some Python code
- deploy the app to the cloud so that is can be publicly accessed and used.
