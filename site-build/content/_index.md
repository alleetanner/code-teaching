### University of Bristol âˆ™ Research Computing Training

Welcome! My name is Alastair Tanner and I develop and deliver teaching for the University of Bristol Research Software Engineering group. For more information about me and my colleagues, please see the _About_ section above.

On this page you will find my current courses. These are aimed at learners wishing to build their computing confidence, to gain a strong coding foundation, and to apply software engineering principles so that code is clean, reusable, efficient and makes sense to other human being. Our wider goals are to promote computer literacy within research, leading to better communication of methods, interpretation of results, and skillsharing within groups. We welcome everyone from beginners to experts, scientists to artists!

Please see the sections below for my courses, and for further information about the RSE team and our other courses, see the _About_ section above.

## [Introduction to the Command Line](https://alleetanner.github.io/intro-to-command-line/)
The command line is a way for us to communicate with computers at a more fundamental level than the familiar graphical interface. However, the command line can seem daunting to newcomers... if the command line seems intimidating, unfriendly, or frustrating, this course is for you! In this session you will
- understand what command line is saying to you
- learn how to move around a computer's file system, making moving and deleting files
- gain an introduction to powerful command line tools for automating tasks

We also provide more advanced sections on pipes and redirects, working with remote computers, as well as some basics for bioinformaticians.

## [BioPython](https://alleetanner.github.io/biopython/)
The genetic revolution continues, with vast amounts of sequence information (genetics, genomic, proteomic and other -omics data) available to researchers. The Python library BioPython has been developed to acquire, manage and process sequence information. This course aims to provide learners with 
- an overview of the capabilities of BioPython
- an introduction to building data acquisition Python scripts
- run some analyses to examine the sequence information for particular characteristics
- as well as be introduced to major sequence archives such as GenBank and Ensembl.

Where appropriate, this course may also include some material on preparing submission scripts for SLURM-managed computing clusters.

{{< admonition type="tip" title="Data Visualisation with Streamlit" open=false >}}
## [Data Visualisation with Streamlit](https://alleetanner.github.io/data-vis-with-streamlit/)
Communication is key for research, and today software tools to express aspects of data are growing in capability and accessibility. In this workshop we use the data visualisation and data-app library, Streamlit. This is a framework for rapidly producing dashboards and user interfaces, using a streamlined Python API. In this workshop we will
- look at an overview of the design and potentials of Streamlit
- create a simple data-app by writing some Python code
- deploy the app to the cloud so that is can be accessed by anyone.
