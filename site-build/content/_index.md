## [Introduction to the Command Line](https://alleetanner.github.io/intro-to-command-line/)
The command line is a way for us to communicate with computers at a more fundamental level than the more familiar graphical interface. If the command line seems intimidating, unfriendly, or frustrating, this course is for you! In this session you will
- understand what command line is saying to you
- learn how to move around a computer's file system, making moving and deleting files
- gain an introduction to powerful command line tools for automating tasks
We also provide more advanced sections on `ssh` to work with remote computers, pipes and redirects, and some basics for bioinformatics.
