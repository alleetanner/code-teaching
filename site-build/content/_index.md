### University of Bristol âˆ™ Research Computing Training

Welcome! My name is Alastair Tanner and I teach computing skills with the University of Bristol Research Software Engineering group. 

On this page you will find my current courses. These are aimed at learners wishing to build their computing confidence and gain a strong coding foundation. We teach with software engineering principles at heart, so that code is clean, reusable, efficient and understandable. Our wider goals are to promote computer literacy within research, leading to better communication of methods, interpretation of results, and skillsharing within groups. We welcome everyone from beginners to experts, scientists to artists!

However, the command line can seem daunting to newcomers... if the command line seems intimidating, unfriendly, or frustrating, this course is for you!

In this course we introduce working with genetic information as nucleotides, amino acids and codons. Given these are typically worked on as plain text files, Python can easily manipulate these and accelerate bioinformatic workflows.

[<img align="left" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alleetanner/code-teaching/main/assets/streamlit.png" width="150" style="margin-right: 15px; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;" />](https://alleetanner.github.io/data-vis-with-streamlit/) In this workshop we introduce the Python data-app library, Streamlit. Streamlit provides a pure Python approach to building data apps and dashboards. It also interfaces with cloud services, bypassing complications associated with publishing web pages, such as managing hosts, servers, domains and traffic. As such, we can focus on making beautiful and useful data apps!
