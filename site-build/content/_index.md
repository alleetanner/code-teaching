### University of Bristol âˆ™ Research Computing Training

Welcome!

This page hosts links to the courses that I run for the University of Bristol Research Software Engineering group. These courses are aimed at learners wishing to build their computing confidence, to gain a strong coding foundation, and to apply software engineering principles so that code is clean, reusable, efficient and makes sense to other human being. Our wider goals are to promote computer literacy within research, leading to better communication of methods, interpretation of results, and skillsharing within groups. We welcome everyone from beginners to experts, scientists to artists!

Please see the sections below for my courses, and for further information about the RSE team and our other courses, see the _About_ section above.

## [Introduction to the Command Line](https://alleetanner.github.io/intro-to-command-line/)
The command line is a way for us to communicate with computers at a more fundamental level than the more familiar graphical interface. If the command line seems intimidating, unfriendly, or frustrating, this course is for you! In this session you will
- understand what command line is saying to you
- learn how to move around a computer's file system, making moving and deleting files
- gain an introduction to powerful command line tools for automating tasks

We also provide more advanced sections on pipes and redirects, working with remote computers, as well as some basics for bioinformaticians.
