At the University of Bristol my role is as a research software engineer. This means that I create code to drive research, I advocate clearly written, meaningful software, and I teach skills to support these things. My education includes an MSci in Evolution & Palaeontology, leading to a doctoral scholarship in teaching and research in molecular evolution. I gained my PhD in phylogenomics is 2018, and since then I have broadened my skills in data science and computation as a member of the RSE team.

My software engineering projects have included code support in molecular evolution, epidemiology, physics, and most recently in development of an open spectroscopy platform for Earth scientists. I enjoy being a scientific generalist, and I have collaborative experience across four schools (Earth Sciences, Life Sciences, Physics and the Medical School) at the University of Bristol.
